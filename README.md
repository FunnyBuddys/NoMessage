# NoMessage

NoMessage is a very simple plugin that disables the messages for joining and leaving a server.








## Announcement

Hello dear community,

in my past, I have often published complete garbage and I stand by that. I WAS pretty bad. BUT I have evolved and want to broaden my horizon now. 

I don't want to publish big projects or plugins (at least not on GitHub). But smaller plugins, which have a high quality code to enrich the community.
